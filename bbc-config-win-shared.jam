#   This file is used to configure your Boost.Build installation. You can modify
# this file in place, or you can place it in a permanent location so that it
# does not get overwritten should you get a new version of Boost.Build. See:
#
#   http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/overview/configuration.html
#
# for documentation about possible permanent locations.

#   This file specifies which toolsets (C++ compilers), libraries, and other
# tools are available. Often, you should be able to just uncomment existing
# example lines and adjust them to taste. The complete list of supported tools,
# and configuration instructions can be found at:
#
#   http://boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/reference/tools.html
#

#   This file uses Jam language syntax to describe available tools. Mostly,
# there are 'using' lines, that contain the name of the used tools, and
# parameters to pass to those tools -- where paremeters are separated by
# semicolons. Important syntax notes:
#
#   - Both ':' and ';' must be separated from other tokens by whitespace
#   - The '\' symbol is a quote character, so when specifying Windows paths you
#     should use '/' or '\\' instead.
#
# More details about the syntax can be found at:
#
#   http://boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/advanced.html#bbv2.advanced.jam_language
